# LIRI-Bot
A LIRI bot CLI using Node.js

---

This application takes in four commands:

-"movie-this", which calls the OMDB API to provide information about a particular movie.

-"concert-this", which uses BandsInTown to show the chosen artist's next concert.

-"spotify-this-song," which calls the Spotify API to return data about a chosen song.

-"do-what-it-says," which uses node's fs module to go inside random.txt and perform the stated request.

I used a small collection of npm modules to get this working, including "request", "fs", "moment", and "axios".

I also used a dotenv file to mask my Spotify API keys.

Here's a link to a YouTube video displaying the working product:
